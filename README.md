Employee-Tracker 
This is an Employee-Tracker that has a command-line application that accepts user input. It can add a new user to any of the departments that are displayed once you run the terminal command. When the terminal
commands are told to run the application then you are able to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
This is an awesome functional page that allows the Employer all these functions.
